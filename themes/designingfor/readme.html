          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p><strong>Q: How do I change the speed of the slide show on the homepage?</strong><br />
          A: The script necessary to run the slide show is located in the header.php file within the theme folder.<br />
          <code><br />
          $('#slideshow').cycle({<br />

          	fx:     'fade',<br />
          	speed:	'750',<br />
          	timeout: 5000,<br />
          	next:   '#next',<br />
              	prev:   '#prev'<br />
           });<br />

          </code><br />
          If you would like to increase / decrease the time between transitions simply increase / decrease the value of <code>timeout</code>. The time is in milliseconds, so for 10 seconds we would increase the value to 10000 and 3 seconds would be 3000.

          <p><strong>Q: How do I show more than 3 slides in the slide show?</strong><br />
          A: You can increase the number of posts pulled into the slide show by opening up your home.php file located within the theme folder and look for this line in the code:<br />
          <code><br />
          &lt;?php $featured = new WP_Query(); $featured->query('showposts=3'); while ($featured->have_posts()) : $featured->the_post(); ?><br />
          </code><br />
          You&#8217;ll want to change the value of showposts to increase the number of slides / posts shown in the slide show. For example, if we wanted to show 5 instead of 3 we would change <code>showposts=3</code> to <code>showposts=5</code>.</p>

          <p><strong>Q: How do I change the logo?</strong><br />
          A: The easiest way to change the logo is to overwrite the current logo.gif image located in the /images/ folder of the theme&#8217;s folder. Note: You may need to perform some anti-aliasing touch-up work depending on the quality &#038; color of the aliasing of your .gif. Using a .gif will allow for transparency when applying the image over the striped background.</p>
          <p>If you have experience using .png (and are not worried about older users of Internet Explorer) you might want to try a .png instead since these give semi-transparency and can ultimately lead to much nicer integration. When using a .png you will need to modify the following line of code in the header.php file of the theme:<br />
          <code><br />
          &lt;div id="logo">&lt;a href="&lt;?php bloginfo('home'); ?>">&lt;img src="&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/images/logo.gif" alt="Designing for the Masses" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div><br />

          </code><br />
          Change the <code>logo.gif</code> to whatever you&#8217;ve named your .png image.</p>
